# Python Program

## Structuring Python Program

The Python program basically consist of 5 terms. Which is commonly used in Python program. Which is as following:

1. Experession
2. Statement
3. Comments
4. Function
5. Blocks & Indentation

# 1. Experession

The Expression is the value which is evaluated during the programing or produces the value. For e.g 9, x-5, etc

# 2. Statements 

The Statements is a single line which tell perform some task like printing the value or solving any expression.In short we can say that statemnet is a programming instruction which does some action. For example, print("How are you"), a + b, etc.

# 3. Comments

The comment does nothing in the program. The programmers use that to explain other programmers what is done in the program throught messages typing in simple words. The program ignore these lines. In Python comment starts with # symbol.

# 4. Function

It is group of codes which can be used anywhere in the program. It starts with def and also it has name through which we can access them or use them anywhere within the code. For e.g 

def Func()

print("This is function")

# 5. Code Block and Indentation

It is set of codes in program which is executed in program. Or the part of the program of other function. And Indentation is used to show blocks of python. Four spaces marks next indentation level
For e.g.

    if y > 15:

    print("The value of y is greater than 15")

    else:

    print("The value of y is less than 15")

This whole is a code block while the print line is indentation.
In short indentation is represented by four space.

## Check If String is valid

We can check any word/string that is string or not by using the module of keyword. We can import keyword module and using that module we can check that the keyowrds in python or check a specific string that it is keyword or not. The program for that is written in program section.

## Assgin Values in Variable

We can simply assign value in python. Whereas in some programming language like C++ we have to tell the datatype to them Whereas in python it takes every value as object so we dont need to tell the datatype. 

In python we assign value as following:
 
    a = 5

    b = "Admin" 

In assigning charaters or special charater we need double inverted commas.

## Print without New line

We can print without new by simply two ways. Both are as following

    print("Hello World")

But in some case if we need to add new word after some code we use end command

    print("Hello", end = " ")
    print("World", end = " ")

## Decision Making in Python

In python and other coding Decision Making playes and important role in it. Because we have to identify the problem in the scenerio and provide an efficient and better solution by using the given resources form which we can easily tackle the problem and resolve it in time. 

## Basic Calculator in python

The code for the Calculator is given in the code section.

## Python language Application and Advantages

First we dicuss about the advantages of python.

# Advantages

The Advantages of the python is as following:

1. It is user friendly language specialy for beginners by its simple and easy syntax.
2. It offers a wide range of Library which cantains solution to some of the problems which we face during the coding.
3. It is open source and available for comercial use.
4. It avoid repetitive task thats they introduce PIP system in which we can use other program to solve. This saves time and increase productivity.
5. It can be used to write scripts with human interfarance and automate workflow.
6. It is platform independent and support SQL.
7. Python is used in many industries like Oracle etc.
8. It is the second highest paid computer languges due to its vast application.

## Application

It is used in:

1. Software Development
2. Data Science
3. Machine Learning
4. Artificial Intelligence
5. Automation
6. Web Scraping
7. Reuse Code and Libraries
